# ADP_dogfight
 
This repository is cratead for simulating two aircraft AIR COMBAT maneuver in 3D/2D environment.

The first working progress made in 2D but not finished there.

After gathering structures of 2D for ADP, I skip implementing 2D and go on 3D.

There are many weights learned from ADP are saved to weights folder.

For training or testing the learned weights 'simulation3d.py' can run.
